Question 1 


Question 2 
The manage.py is a program that offers CLI commands to interact with out django project.
With the runserver argument, it starts up a web server. 
This web server is meant for development environment; not production. 

For now, the webpage showing a rocket taking off.
Also links to django documentation, tutorial, and community 


Question 3 
At /, It displays a 404 Error Page, because the URL configuration did not match any URL patterns defined in the URL configurations.
You can access /admin and /polls

At /polls, it returns a page with "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."
Just like how we defined it within the polls/views.py index function



Question 4 
Mirgrations are essentially a save of the changes made to the models (in database schema)
It's saved as files, and managed by a database managed by the Django framework.

We use the makemirgrations django command to save migrations and apply them with migrate djangon command

Migrations allow:
    upgrading databases live, without losing data 
    essentially have a VCS for your database



Question 5 
After logging into the admin website, I see:
- Authentication and Authorization for users and groups
- My Polls app with the Questions model 

To get custom models to appear in the page, write:
    admin.site.register( MODEL_CLASS_NAME )
Access the admin module and call site.register passing in the class name
