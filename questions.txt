At /, It displays a 404 Error Page, because the URL configuration did not match any URL patterns defined in the URL configurations.
You can access /admin and /polls

Just like how we defined it within the polls/views.py index function

Mirgrations are essentially a save of the changes made to the models (in database schema)
It's saved as files, and managed by a database managed by the Django framework.

    essentially have a VCS for your database
