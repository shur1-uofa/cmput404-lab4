Question 1 


Question 2 
The manage.py is a program that offers CLI commands to interact with out django project.
With the runserver argument, it starts up a web server. 
This web server is meant for development environment; not production. 

For now, the webpage showing a rocket taking off.
Also links to django documentation, tutorial, and community 


Question 3 
At /, It displays a 404 Error Page, because the URL configuration did not match any URL patterns defined in the URL configurations.
You can access /admin and /polls

At /polls, it returns a page with "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."
Just like how we defined it within the polls/views.py index function



Question 4 
Mirgrations are essentially a save of the changes made to the models (in database schema)
It's saved as files, and managed by a database managed by the Django framework.

We use the makemirgrations django command to save migrations and apply them with migrate djangon command

Migrations allow:
    upgrading databases live, without losing data 
    essentially have a VCS for your database



Question 5 
After logging into the admin website, I see:
- Authentication and Authorization for users and groups
- My Polls app with the Questions model 

To get custom models to appear in the page, write:
    admin.site.register( MODEL_CLASS_NAME )
Access the admin module and call site.register passing in the class name



Question 6
/polls/38/ - Just a text saying "You're looking at question 38."
/polls/38/results - "You're looking at the results of question 38."
/polls/38/vote - "You're voting on question 38."
As you would expect in the method body of each associated view 

To consume strings instead of integer, supply this url pattern.
    "<str:args>/"
So maybe:
    path("<str:question_id>", views.detail, name="detail")



Question 7
It adds coupling and violates DRY principle.
Any hardcoded URL that needs to change will have to be changed in every place it has been hard coded in.
However with template tags referencing urls, we only need to change one place: urls.py



Question 8
